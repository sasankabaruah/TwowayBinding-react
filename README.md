# TwowayBinding-react
This is a simple  react  project to show how we can send method as a props to another component , which is nothing but a call back to the parent component.

In this project I have a Person component which is getting rendered conditionally depending upon my showPerson (Which is defined in the state of APP component).

I have send the "name"  from my App component state to Person component as a props.Person component will render this name in UI , also it will render an input element.


To start the project you have to install node js ,which will automatically install npm.
Install create-react-app globally using "npm install -g create-react-app".
Now Go to your folder where you have taken the clone and write npm start to run the project.
